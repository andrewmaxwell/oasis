Brennan's original notes:

Database Requirements
Must include the following info: 
  Parent Name
  Address
  Phone# (Maybe multiple)
  Kid Name
  Kid Gender
  Kid birthday
  Kid Diaper Size
  *May be multiple children under same parent
  Country of origin 
  Rough Family Income (requirement from non-profit)
  Archive of past people that are no longer active
  Planned Deliverer
Must be easily editable by single user. 

Automated tasks
*In priority order
*Tasks should be nearly automatic – no updating multiple files to be able to stuff
  Generate a consolidated diaper order based on who is active in database
  Generate label file to be stuck to diaper packs – Label file should contain:
    Parent Name
    Address
    Phone
    Diaper Size
    Deliverer
  Label file preferred to be organized by deliverer
*Current label file uses mail-merge feature in Microsoft word to generate a PDF that has text in the correct places to print on an Avery 5263 shipping label sheet. These print on a standard printer (8.5 x 11 sheet with 2” x 4” labels). 
*Would be open to using a brother labeler or similar if it makes the system better
Generate a Diaper Day reference sheet for Selia to use on diaper distribution day. Should contain: 
All info on label files organized by zip code then alphabetical
*Will need to talk to Selia a bit more in depth to tailor her reference sheet to her preferences. 
Generate a monthly report
Record of diapers ordered
Record of who got diapers that month
Generate text for generic reminder email to deliverers. Email shall be customized to recipient. Contains: 
Date of next diaper pickup day
Who they will be picking up for (Name, address, phone, Size)
When they can pick up
Contact info of Selia for questions
Invite to provide size feedback for next month
Check database for children that are too old
Add a feature to the monthly report (above) that highlights any kids older than 2 and sorts them in oldest to youngest order. With the list of kids include all the same info as what would go on a diaper label. 

-----
1. 4 users. (2 of them will be "read-only") - a user will log on weekly or bi-weekly to update sizes and place monthly orders
2. I think two types of account - a read only user and a standard user
3. Planned deliverer changes very often. Only about 40% have a consistent delivery person. For those without a consistent delivery person it can be left as blank and it can be assigned on-the-fly. 
4. The diaper #s are as follows: 
Size 7 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 6 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 5 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 4 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 3 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 2 - 50 diapers per month per kid
Size 1 - 75 diapers per month per kid
Size N (for newborn) - 75 diapers per month per kid
